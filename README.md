# First Python Programs

Files for several little Python projects that I made after my Introduction to Python class from earlier in the year.

## Calendar

Console app that lets the user select between a few choices in a menu for things relating to time such as Christmas countdown, days left in the year, if the current year is a leap year, 
print the current time, and others.  Created this to get a better understanding of things you can do with the time module.

## Calculator

Console calculator app that lets the user input two values and then an operator.  Afterwards the value is printed to the console.  Includes checks for 0 division.  Created this to get a 
better understanding of using try and except statements.

## Game

Console app of the classic children's game Hangman. Player one will submit a word and a five word or less hint.  Afterward Player two will begin to guess the word.  The guessing play 
receives a total amount of wrong chances equal to the length of the word + 2.  The guessing player is allowed a free chance to guess the entire word after each letter submission.  
After all chances have been expended the game ends and a result is declared.
